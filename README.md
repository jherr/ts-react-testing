## Basic Component Testing
- Demonstrates how to write basic tests for React components.
- Includes examples of rendering components and making assertions.

## Multiple Element Testing
- Explains how to test components with multiple elements.
- Shows how to target specific elements and verify their properties.

## Event Handler Testing
- Covers testing event handlers in React components.
- Provides examples of triggering events and testing their effects.

## Testing State Hooks
- Demonstrates testing components that use React state hooks.
- Includes examples of asserting the state changes.

## Testing Async Hooks
- Shows how to test components using asynchronous hooks.
- Includes testing async side effects and responses.

## Testing Simple Custom Hooks
- Explains how to test custom hooks that manage simple state.
- Includes testing hook functionality in isolation.

## Testing Async Custom Hooks
- Demonstrates testing custom hooks with asynchronous behavior.
- Shows how to mock async dependencies and test hook behavior.

## Testing Redux Components

Feel free to explore the individual sections for detailed examples and explanations.

For each section, there are corresponding test files in the `src` directory to demonstrate the testing techniques.

## Getting Started

- Run tests using `npm test` or `yarn test`.
- Run tests with verbose output:

```sh
npm test -- --verbose
```
- Run tests with coverage output:

```sh
npm test -- --coverage
```

Happy Testing!
